# GENERAL SETTINGS
#

# This parameter indicated the data field size in bytes of a CCSDS
# packet, by changing this parameter the data will be segmented
# accordingly by the encoder.

# insert sync pattern between packets. which marks the start of the
# CCSDS packet. If enabled the default sync pattern will be used.
# Alternatively refer to the optional "sync_pattern" parameter.

# <optional> sync pattern is used if sync_pattern_enable is enabled.
# it will use default sync pattern "0x1ACFFC1D" is custom sync pattern
# is required uncomment the following argument.

#
# TEMPLATE PACKET SETTINGS
#

# 3 bit first of packet identification, which indicate the version of
